# Hypothesis-Testing
A data is shared on the survival of the Titanic passengers with respect to their status. I calculated the p-values for the difference between the means for  1 - the crew and 3rd class passengers and  2 - the 1st class passengers and the rest.  I plotted the pdf and cdf graphs for the  probability distributions of the differences when the null hypotheses are true.
